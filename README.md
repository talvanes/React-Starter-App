# React Starter App

This is a React starter project that uses Babel and Webpack in its structure. Simple to use. Ready to debug.

The following tutorial inspired this project: https://blog.usejournal.com/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658

## Installation

First, clone its GitHub repo, like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/talvanes/React-Starter-App.git
```

Next, enter the directory that has been created and update everything, as in:

```
cd React-Starter-App
npm update
```

Then, start programming right there!

There's a way to rename folders while cloning repos. Please [check this out](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository).

## Usage

Start a development server to play with the project and check your modifications:

```
npm start
```

Since you are done with it, just build it for production with:

```
npm build
```

Though, if you would like a bit more advice on what you have been doing on your project before you'd put it into production right away, just do a "hinting", like this:

```
npm hint
```

By default, this project supports the most common formats thanks to Webpack's loaders (images, audio and video files). If you would like to support another format, refer to their website: https://webpack.js.org/loaders/ to get to know it.

Babel can also be configured, too. For instance, you could add [TypeScript support](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript) or ever. Head for https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins/ for more information.

## Support

Contact me at talvanes_sousa@hotmail.com, talvanes.ferreira.sousa@gmail.com or talvanes@zoho.com for better support, or if you're having some kind of trouble.

## Roadmap

I am planning on inserting a test script to test every aspect of the project, so that we will have everything possible covered. And it will be run, as in:

```
npm test
```

Also, I will add linting support, and it will be run any time with:

```
npm lint
```

Stay tuned!

Also, I will create a Wiki only for the  project in order to better document it.
